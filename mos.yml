# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

config_schema:
 - ["device.id", "s","esp32_0DF8D0",{title: "My app custom settings"}]
 - ["wifi.sta.enable", "b", false, {title: "Some boolean value"}]
 - ["wifi.sta.ssid", "s", "priyank", {title: "Some string value"}]
 - ["wifi.sta.pass", "s", "1234567890", {title: "Some integer value"}]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
